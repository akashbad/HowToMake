Bluetooth Pocket Boombox
========================

My first idea is to create a pocket sized boombox that will connect to my phone via bluetooth. I have always wanted something I could carry around either in my wallet or about the size of my wallet that would be able to play music out loud and act as a speaker for conference calls. Imagine how cool it would be to pull a speaker out of your pocket and start playing music from your phone wherever you are.

</div>

I think the project would also be just challenging enough from a hardware perspective (having to navigate the nuances of bluetooth connectivity) and also very interesting from a design perspective. I could either take the super thin approach used by designer [Hannes Harms](http:\\hannesharms.com) in the first image, or something a bit thicker like the [Jawbone Jambox Mini](http:\\jawbone.com\speakers\minijambox). I am also considering adding LED's behind the speaker grill in order to add a little extra visual flair!

Quadcopter
==========

My other idea would be to create a quadcopter from scratch. In particular I am interested in molding an interesting shell for the drone and then building the whole controller from scratch. Most DIY projects feature something like the [Ardupilot](http:\\ardupilot.com) which is an excellent solution combining sensors and the microcontroller itself along with some libraries for hooking things up and getting going quickly. I would be interested in tackling the configuration of the motion sensors with the microcontroller and then programming all of the algorithms myself.
